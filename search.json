Homes built after 1980 generally have larger median living areas and finished basements, with greater variability in size. The presence of outliers, particularly in newer homes, suggests a wider range of home sizes over time.

Explain your final model choice (algorithm, tuning parameters, etc) and describe what other models you tried.\nThe code builds a Random Forest classification model to predict whether a home was built before 1980 using various home features. First, it preprocesses the dataset by dropping non-relevant columns (parcel and year built), encoding categorical variables with one-hot encoding, and splitting the data into training and testing sets. The model is trained using 100 decision trees (n_estimators=100) and evaluated on the test set. The accuracy score is printed along with a classification report, showing performance metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, the feature importance values from the Random Forest model are displayed, helping to identify which variables contribute the most to the prediction. The goal is to achieve at least 90% accuracy in classifying homes based on their construction period.\n\n\nShow the code\n# Include and execute your code here\n# 1.

This discussion should include a feature importance chart and a description of the features.\nThe code evaluates the feature importance in the Random Forest classification model used to predict whether a home was built before 1980. After preprocessing the dataset by encoding categorical variables and removing unnecessary columns, the model is trained and evaluated, achieving an accuracy score. The feature importance values are then extracted and visualized using a bar plot, where the most influential features are displayed. This helps identify key factors contributing to the prediction, such as home size, basement area, or specific categorical attributes. The flipped bar chart makes it easier to interpret which features have the highest impact, aiding in refining the model and understanding the underlying data patterns.\n\n\nShow the code\n# Include and execute your code here\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\nfrom lets_plot import *\n\n# Drop unnecessary columns\ncolumns_to_drop = ['before1980', 'parcel', 'yrbuilt']\ndf_cleaned = df.drop(columns=[col for col in columns_to_drop if col in df.columns])\n\n# Separate features and target variable\nX = df_cleaned\ny = df['before1980']  # Removed the extra space in column name\n\n# Identify categorical columns\ncategorical_columns = X.select_dtypes(include=['object']).columns\n\n# Apply pd.get_dummies to categorical columns\nX_dummies = pd.get_dummies(X, columns=categorical_columns, drop_first=True)\n\n# Avoid multicollinearity\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_dummies, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n\n# Train the model\nmodel = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)\nmodel.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n# Predict on test set\ny_pred = model.predict(X_test)\n\n# Evaluate the model\naccuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)\nprint(f\"Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%\")\n\n# Feature importance analysis (Final Fix)\nfeature_importances = pd.DataFrame({\n    'Feature': list(X_dummies.columns),  # Ensure it's a list\n    'Importance': model.feature_importances_  # Ensure it's the correct attribute\n})\n\n# Sort values correctly\nfeature_importances = feature_importances.sort_values(by='Importance', ascending=True)\n\n# Initialize lets-plot\nLetsPlot.setup_html()\n\n# Create a ggplot-style bar plot for feature importance\nplot = ggplot(feature_importances) + \\\n    geom_bar(aes(x='Feature', y='Importance'), stat='identity', fill='blue') + \\\n    ggtitle('Feature Importance in Random Forest Classifier (Using Dummies)') + \\\n    xlab('Feature') + \\\n    ylab('Feature Importance') + \\\n    coord_flip()  # Flip axes for better readability\n\n# Display the plot\nplot\n\n\nAccuracy: 93.06%",

    "text": "QUESTION|TASK 4\nDescribe the quality of your classification model using 2-3 different evaluation metrics. You also need to explain how to interpret each of the evaluation metrics you use.\n_Model Evaluation and Interpretation The classification model was evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score, along with a Confusion Matrix. The classification report provides key evaluation metrics that help assess the model’s predictive ability, indicating whether it favors one class over the other and identifying areas for improvement.\nAccuracy (93%): Accuracy measures the proportion of correctly classified instances out of all predictions. The model achieved high accuracy, correctly classifying most homes in the dataset.\nPrecision (0.91 for class 0, 0.94 for class 1): Precision evaluates how many homes predicted as a certain class were correctly classified. A precision of 0.91 for homes built after 1980 and 0.94 for homes built before 1980 indicates a low false positive rate, meaning the model makes confident and correct predictions.\nRecall (0.90 for class 0, 0.95 for class 1): Recall measures how well the model captures actual instances of each class. The high recall values suggest the model effectively identifies most homes in each category, with a slight tendency to predict homes built before 1980 more accurately.\nF1-Score (0.93 macro average): The F1-score balances precision and recall, providing a single performance metric. The high F1-score confirms that the model effectively distinguishes between homes built before and after 1980.\nThe support column in the classification report shows the number of actual instances for each class in the test set, which helps in understanding class distribution. The confusion matrix reveals that the model performs well in classifying both categories, with very few misclassifications. Compared to a previous model with 48% accuracy, this improved model demonstrates significant enhancements in predictive ability, suggesting the effectiveness of better feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, and data preprocessing.\nRecommendations for Further Improvement: Feature Engineering: Exploring additional home attributes (e.g., year of last renovation, neighborhood characteristics) may further refine predictions. Hyperparameter Tuning: Adjusting parameters such as tree depth and the number of estimators could provide additional accuracy gains. Cross-Validation: Implementing k-fold cross-validation could ensure the model generalizes well across different data splits. With 93% accuracy and strong classification performance, this model is well-suited for predicting whether a home was built before or after 1980._\n\n\nShow the code\n# Include and execute your code here\nprint (metrics.classification_report(y_test, y_pred))\nprint (\"Feature importances:\",importances)\n\n\n              precision    recall  f1-score   support\n\n           0       0.91      0.90      0.91      1710\n           1       0.94      0.95      0.94      2873\n\n    accuracy                           0.93      4583\n   macro avg       0.93      0.93      0.93      4583\nweighted avg       0.93      0.93      0.93      4583\n\nFeature importances: [3.73965384e-02 8.86404177e-02 2.49136491e-02 4.31657766e-02\n 2.16141593e-03 6.14631048e-02 2.90057753e-02 2.45616632e-02\n 6.48080114e-02 5.55982537e-02 1.74369409e-02 6.04108063e-02\n 6.04083721e-02 2.55805564e-02 1.14106959e-02 2.05986045e-02\n 1.09215714e-04 0.00000000e+00 1.64079225e-02 8.19300287e-04\n 3.26887224e-03 2.98442044e-02 3.78906230e-02 1.63004653e-03\n 7.33468723e-04 5.89480608e-02 4.79540514e-04 8.00795321e-05\n 2.39179190e-02 7.04714984e-03 1.93053775e-05 4.67315465e-04\n 1.09213576e-03 1.05718511e-03 1.15035548e-02 8.52804928e-03\n 9.40801422e-03 8.66173052e-02 3.67436387e-04 2.69622205e-04\n 2.53616941e-03 2.61835174e-03 6.56814021e-04 2.70744695e-02\n 5.93068297e-03 6.30875532e-03 1.38328233e-02 1.29750247e-02]",
